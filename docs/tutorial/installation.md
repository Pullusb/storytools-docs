> How to install software and addons

Note that everything is also detailed in the [Setup Project](tutorial/setup-project.md) page.

## Blender

You need the software [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), with a mininum version of 4.0 and maximum version 4.2


## Storytools addons

<!-- (or [SPA build](https://the-spa-studios.github.io/blender-spa-userdoc/) Windows only) -->

Storytools is available on the [official storytools repository](https://github.com/Pullusb/storytools).

> It will be added in blender-extension platform in a near future for direct download in blender

<!-- Storytools can be installed in Blender directly within using the extension platform. -->

Starting blender 4.2, you can simply drag-n-drop downloaded zip file on Blender window for installation

On Blender version _before_ 4.2, see this tutorial on [how to install Blender addons](https://github.com/Pullusb/How_to_install_Blender_addons)


## Sequencer tool

Storytools take only care of objects management and controls in viewport.

It's already usefull for general 2D animations but for a full storyboard setup, it need to be used in tandem with another addon to handle the sequence and shot management

Though you can use any other means for shot management, it's  **Spa-sequencer** addon, created at SPA studios that will be referenced in this documentation. More infos about it in the [shot management page](tutorial/shot-management.md).

As of now (sept. 2024) in blender standard it's preferable to use **SPArk** a more up to date fork
