# Shot management


## Why Spa sequencer

For the shot management, we will be using the **spa-sequencer** addon

It was made to work with a dedicated build **spa-blender** but can work with standard Blender as well, and the compatibility will better in the future

If you want to learn more in detail about how it works and it's origin, look at the [presentation from the authors at Blender Conference 2022](https://youtu.be/0HNmJebYY8M?si=B_IyGVWBMoxCzGiD&t=1938) at 32:18 (Link set at the right time)

To resume shortly. It is simple, powerfull and versatile at the same time.
