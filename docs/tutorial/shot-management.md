# Shot management


## Why SPA sequencer ?

For the shot management, we will be using the **spa-sequencer** addon

It was made to work with a dedicated build **spa-blender** but can now work with standard Blender as well, and the compatibility will be even better in the future.

If you want to learn more in detail about how it works and it's origin, look at the [presentation from the authors at Blender Conference 2022](https://youtu.be/0HNmJebYY8M?si=B_IyGVWBMoxCzGiD&t=1938) at 32:18 (Link set at the right time)

It is powerfull, versatile and simple enough to achieve results.


As of now (sept 2024), it's preferable to use a more up to date fork [SPArk](https://github.com/NickTiny/SPArk-sequencer-addon)
