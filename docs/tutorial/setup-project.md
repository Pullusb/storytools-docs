> How to setup a storyboard session

Storytools add controls and objects management

To setup the shots, you need to use *Spa-sequencer* addon (recommended) but you can use any alternative you prefer (ex: Storypencil)

**Spa-sequencer** has a very complete [documentation](https://the-spa-studios.github.io/blender-spa-userdoc/) 

The addon is meant to be used with a special SPA build (windows only, link in spa-documentation homepage).  
But it can actually be used with Blender standard, at the cost of having to use a dual window, one for the sequencer, the other for the viewport.

In the future, it will be possible to use in standard blender in single window mode.


## How to use Spa-sequencer in Blender standard

To create an aditional window, go to the main header menu: `Window > New Main Window`

Now this window will be used for the sequencer. arrange the window so it stay visible below the revious window.

Set the `EDIT` scene and activate sync. Now this window will control the shot displayed in the other.
