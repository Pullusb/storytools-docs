## Storyboarding with Storytools

Storytools take only care of objects management and controls in viewport.  
For a full storyboard setup, it need to be used in tandem with another addon to handle the shot management

It is srongly recommended to use **Spa-sequencer**.  
As of now (sept 2024), it's preferable to use **SPArk** a more up to date fork, [Get SPArk here](https://github.com/NickTiny/SPArk-sequencer-addon)

Here is the link to [original spa-sequencer repository](https://github.com/The-SPA-Studios/sequencer-addon)

Though you can use any other means for shot management, it's spa-sequencer/SPArk that will be referenced in this documentation.

For more infos about it, head to the [shot management page](tutorial/shot-management.md)
