## Installation

You will need the software [Blender](https://www.blender.org/), with a mininum version of 4.0 and maximum version 4.2 
<!-- (or [SPA build](https://the-spa-studios.github.io/blender-spa-userdoc/) Windows only) -->


Storytools is available on the [official storytools repository](https://github.com/Pullusb/storytools).

> It will be added in blender-extension platform in a near future for direct download in blender

<!-- Storytools can be installed in Blender directly within using the extension platform. -->

Starting blender 4.2, you can simply drag-n-drop downloaded zip file on Blender window for installation

On Blender version _before_ 4.2, see this tutorial on [how to install Blender addons](https://github.com/Pullusb/How_to_install_Blender_addons): 


## Use of SPA sequener

Storytools take only care of objects management and controls in viewport.  
For a full storyboard setup, it need to be used in tandem with another addon to handle the shot management

Though you can use any other means for shot management, it's  **Spa-sequencer** addon, created at SPA studios that will be referenced in this documentation.

As of now (sept. 2024) in blender standard it's preferable to use **SPArk** a more up to date fork  
[Get SPArk here](https://github.com/NickTiny/SPArk-sequencer-addon)
