## Storyboard

Storytools take only care of objects management and controls in viewport.
For a full storyboard setup, it need to be used in tandem with another addon to handle the shot management part

It is srongly recommended to use [spa-sequencer addon](https://github.com/The-SPA-Studios/sequencer-addon) or it's fork [SPArk](https://github.com/NickTiny/SPArk-sequencer-addon)

Though you can use any other means for shot management, it's spa-sequencer that will be referenced in this documentation.

For more infos about it, head to the [shot management page](tutorial/shot-management.md)
